# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions for advent of code 2020 (https://adventofcode.com/2020)

This is my third year doing AoC, and my second using rust.

In addition to the rust solutions, I've done some of the puzzles as python one-liners (just for giggles).
I've done a couple of blogs explaining the one-liners [here](https://oatzy.github.io/2020/12/06/advent-of-code-2020-python-oneliners.html) and [here](https://oatzy.github.io/2020/12/13/advent-of-code-2020-week2-oneliners.html)
